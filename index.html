    <h2>What is an Isogram Checker doing?</h2>
    <p>An isogram is a word or phrase in which each letter appears only once. This means that there are no repeated
        letters in the word. For example, the word "lighthouse" is an isogram because each letter appears only once,
        while the word "banana" is not an isogram because the letter "a" appears three times. Isograms can be found in
        many different languages and are often used in puzzles and word games as a challenge for players to find words
        with unique letters.</p>
